	abstract = {By transforming the topology of city blocks and roads into grids, and using two-dimensional cellular automata model with different traffic capacity to express the roads with different widths, a simulation model of urban macroscopic traffic flow is presented and the operation rules of cellular automata are designed in this paper. In view of the characteristics of distributed occurrence, evanescence and time variation of traffic flow, the quantity of traffic OD (origin-destination) is updated step by step according to simulation time. The macroscopic running track and quantity distribution of urban traffic flow within a period are simulated through the operation of cellular automata. The results of simulation have reference value for urban road traffic planning and traffic flow evacuation.},
