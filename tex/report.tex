\section{Abstract}
This paper is based on another research paper in cellular automata in which city
traffic and its affection by factors like distributed occurrence, evanescence,
and time variation is observed on a two-dimensional grid. The variables used in
this new experiment include diagonal paths, one-way streets, pre-generated
flows, varying speeds, varying destination priority, and different types of
roads. With these additional factors in the experiment, the results of the new
simulation will yield results that more accurately reflect the environment of
real-world traffic.

\section{Research Statement}
There are a few interesting changes we could make to the original algorithm in
order to explore the impact of different traffic environments and flows. For
example, the original paper randomly generates \textit{traffic flows} which are
an abstracted representation of the traffic that really represents a group of
vehicles as a random amount of traffic. Additionally, when each traffic flow is
generated, the destination of the flow is also generated randomly. After the
traffic flow is generated and the destination is chosen, the traffic flow
chooses it's path automatically as the shortest distance from the starting cell
to the current cell. Finally, the original paper uses one traffic environment
with simple two-way roads that are placed on the grid laterally and vertically. 

One idea we would like to explore is to add different priorities for cells as
destinations. If a cell is a high priority destination, then it is more likely 
to be chosen as a destination for a traffic flow when it is generated. Another
improvement could also allow for modelling of different types of roads. For
example, rather than the flow taking the shortest path from the source to the
destination, each cell could have a parameter for the weight of adding that cell
to the path of the traffic flow. If the weight of adding the cell to the path is
low, that cell may be modeled as part of a road that can handle more traffic
such as a highway. The original experiment also did not test diagonal or one-way
streets, so that may be valuable for a traffic flow model as well.

\section{Literature Review}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Simulation of urban macro-traffic flow based on cellular automata \cite{pang_simulation_2019}
    \begin{description}
        \item This paper uses a cellular automata model to simulate traffic flow on a
        two-dimensional grid. Traffic flows are randomly generated that have a
        certain amount of traffic (low or heavy) and also have a random
        destination. There exists a grid with cells filled in which are meant to
        model the roads for the traffic flow to move on. On each timestep, the
        traffic flows move towards their destination using a minimum distance
        method. The cells can hold a certain amount of traffic capacity. When
        the traffic capacity for a cell is reached, the cell will not allow new
        traffic flows to enter the cell. The cell also have a traffic volume,
        which helps the programmer to see at a glance which cells have high and
        low volumes of traffic.

    \item A cellular automaton model for freeway traffic \cite{nagel_cellular_1992}
    \begin{description}
        \item Nagel and Schreckenberg have gone away from the typical fluid dynamical
        approaches to traffic flow studies during this time to the use of a more
        revoluationary technique. The need for this was to introduce a factor of
        laminar start-stop waves with increasing vehicle density with an
        emphasis on human behavior a traffic environment. In their
        model, it is represented as a single dimensional array where each cell
        may be a vehicle with functions to accelearte, slow down, as well as
        randomized velocities. These functions are to represent the randomness
        in human behavior and varying conditions that are expected during
        traffic. The authors concluded that a computational way to simulate
        traffic flow, was more advantagous to a fluid dynamical approach that
        incorporated real world behavior ofa driver but also retained the key
        aspects of fluid dynamic studies.

    \item Self-organization and phase transition in traffic-flow model of a
    two-lane roadway \cite{nagatani_self-organization_1993}
    \begin{description}
        \item Tasdf
    \end{description}
    \item Multi-value cellular automata model for mixed bicycle flow \cite{jia_multi-value_2007}
    \begin{description}
        \item Tasdf
    \end{description}
    \item Cellular automaton model for bidirectional traffic \cite{simon_cellular_1998-1}
    \begin{description}
        \item Simon and Gutowitz have built upon the paper referenced above by Nagel
        and Schreckenberg. Here they are implementing a bidrectional traffic using a two
        lane road with traffic moving in opposite direction in comparison to Nagel and Schreckenberg's one lane cellular automaton.
        They have incorporated inteteractions to simulate passing, as well as a
        distribution of varying vehicle speeds. Once again, Simon and gutowitz,
        like their reference model, had an emphasis on approximating the
        behavior of real traffic and human behavior. They wanted to address the
        issue of a one lane cellular atomaton where all vehicles have a maximum
        velocity  and thus the model unrealistically follows a lead slow car,
        hence the need and emphasis on passing. The bidirectional model varried
        in types where there was varrying rules regarding passing. The
        researchers have found that passing greatly increases fluidity in
        traffic not seen in single dimensional cellular automaton and greatly
        resembles real world traffic dynamics and flow.

\section{Methods}
For this project, we plan to use Python to implement our cellular automata
traffic flow model. We may also include a GUI to visualize the traffic flow
on each time step. This section will be expanded as the project progresses.

\section{Project Management}
Our project has already set up weekly meetings in order to share progress and
updates, and we schedule ad-hoc meetings when necessary. Additionally, we have
our project inside of a github repository, where we can easily share our updated
code. We plan to make use of pair-programming sessions, where we can collaborate
while also sharing the load of programming.
